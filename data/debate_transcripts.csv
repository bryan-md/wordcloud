When you were asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer and 45 seconds for followups. So let’s begin. Senator Sanders, we haven’t had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower. How will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?",31.0
02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Bernie Sanders,"Well, you’re right, the economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires. In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. But you know what, for the ordinary American things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than one percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are under-insured. 45 million people are struggling with student debt. 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans. That is not an economy that’s working for the American people. That’s an economy working for the one percent. We’re going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.",59.0

02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Michael Bloomberg,I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he’s president.

02-25-2020,South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Elizabeth Warren,"Look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas. Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.",60.0

They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof.

The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.",38.0

I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks.

A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should.

It matters if you can actually get things done. It is not just who talks to the best, who actually gets things done.

Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing, because we don’t have an adequate mental health system to support kids. And now some politicians, because they aren’t willing to face the need for common sense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there’s a threat to a classroom. We have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall, our regard for those who are educating our kids.

I think when I’ve looked at this, both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live. So the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of this Section 8 backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting, and I have found a way to pay for this, and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.

So the answer is, one size doesn’t fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called Critical Access Hospitals, so they’re designated for rural areas. And actually, I am the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms, in rural areas be covered. The other issue is we don’t have enough personnel.

We’re not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees, we’re going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses. So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one and two year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.

See, all of these things are connected. Housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles, to the closing of voting locations.

I actually lived in Israel for some months, but what I happen to believe is that right now, sadly, tragically, in Israel, through Bibi Netanyahu, you have a reactionary racist who is now running that country. And I happen to believe, I happen to believe, that what our foreign policy in the mid-east should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel.

Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race. And there’s a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race. What hasn’t changed? A majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you, Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he’s best positioned to win in November. Why is your revolution a better bet?",38.0
02-19-2020,"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"In order to beat Donald Trump, we’re going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. What our movement is about is bringing working class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change.

Look, I’ll support whoever the democratic nominee is, but understand this, Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.

We’re getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing. 500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can’t afford medical bills. So let me be very clear, to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union, I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have.

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Joe Biden,"Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We’re going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie’s labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that’s the label that the President’s going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he’s a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He’s a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we’ll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.",41.0
02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,George S.,"Senator Sanders, let me give you the chance to respond first. President Trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work.

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don’t believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%. If we do that nationally, we’re going to defeat Donald Trump.",39.0

And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense.

And I don’t think there’s any question, but that the only way that we’re going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means we’re going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you can’t do that, then we can’t beat Donald Trump in November and we can’t choose a candidate who can’t do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. That’s what it’s going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters.

We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides.

People across this country, whether they’re Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that we’ve got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it’s not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is.

But he’s been, the Republicans have rolled over, they’ve had a sham trial, they’ve refused to have witnesses. They’ve covered up the truth for the American people. And it doesn’t matter anymore that he’s a crook, and he’s always been a crook, and he always will be a crook. Right now, what we have to do is we have to beat him in November, and we have to beat him because he’s incompetent, and bad for the American people. And that’s the case we have to make now.",47.0

But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November, and that’s going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people. The fact that he’s incompetent as a president, his economy isn’t delivering for working people. The jobs don’t pay enough for people to live on.

This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president. The vice president and I and all of us are competing. But we’ve got to draw a line here. And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.",49.0

One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we’re going to do and how we’re going to do it. And by the way, Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House, walked out. I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman, and not on rush Limbaugh.

I want to turn to America’s role in the world and readiness to be commander-in-chief on day one. Just this week, you saw it, during the State of the Union, President Trump offered an indication of what he’ll tout on the campaign trail. He celebrated the US air strike that killed top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani saying, “Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.”",25.0

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"In the situation that we saw with President Trump’s decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer. Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated. It’s also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it’s that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing. This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didn’t start with the Soleimani strike. It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working. And it’s time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve.",53.0

What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives.",52.0

It’s not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, it’s about preventing a war with Iran.

It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf. I know how to deal with them.

And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes. It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries. So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education.",46.0

We know Granite Staters are engaged and we know there are issues that strike especially close to home here. New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of deadly overdoses in the country. In some cases, police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again, sometimes more than once in a single day. It’s a healthcare issue, but it’s also so much more. Mayor Buttigieg, you have described yourself as a moderate, but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go. You have called for the decriminalization of all drugs. Does that include heroin, meth, and cocaine, some of the drugs that have contributed to this crisis?",40.0

This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful. It’s why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable. We’ve got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances.

As a prosecutor, you embrace tough on crime policies, even with drug offenders. You’ve also spoken many times about your father’s own addiction issues, his own alcoholism and his DUI arrests.

And maybe you’re referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs. Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed.

Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion. And just like every other policy I’ve proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how I’m going to pay for it.

New Hampshire is a battleground, not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy. Senator Sanders, for many voters in this Democratic primary, your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues you’ve been on the right side of them for a long time. One exception is gun rights. In the ’90s when you were in Congress, you voted against background checks. You also voted against a waiting period for purchase of a firearm.

In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country, and we go further. We go further, but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA.

So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, I’m the guy that set up drug courts. I set them up. I wrote it into law and it never got funded. And also on opioids, I’m the guy who’s already begun to make a down payment. In the Cures Act I put in $1 billion to fight opioid addiction. And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely.

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Pete Buttigieg,"Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune.

But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, it’s great that everybody’s so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.",55.0

For the exact same crimes, study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained, to be arrested, to be taken to trial, to be wrongfully convicted, and receive harsher sentences. We need to rework our criminal justice system, from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system, and how we help people come back into the community.",42.0
02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Elizabeth Warren,"But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically.

You can’t just repeal that and say “Okay, now everything is even.” It’s not.

What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We can’t regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.",56.0

Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, 10-15-30. We should be investing our money in those communities that haven’t gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison. I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison. And we fund it.

But there’s something else insidious going on that we haven’t addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting.

Racism is terrible, we all want to do something,” and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think it’s time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people’s lives. I proposed a two cent wealth tax. And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out, that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points.",59.0

I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage that’s been done officially, and pretending we’re all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way.

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Bernie Sanders,"There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I don’t know how in 2020 you can do that. Second of all, there is, in terms of outsourcing of jobs, a major crisis in this country. Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico, where workers are paid in some cases less than $2 an hour. So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement. I don’t apologize for that.",33.0

02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"Well, first of all, I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them. Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, I’ll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one.",48.0
02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations. But I’m telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change.",27.0

There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they can’t get enforcement of any workers’ rights. So this NAFTA provision, after a lot of negotiation with Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better. This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country, I’m saying, I’ll sign up for that and then I’ll get up tomorrow morning and I’ll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate, a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it.

Everybody wants to get into our market, and that’s how we convince them that they’ve got to be right on climate too. That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way. Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and it’s absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, we’re thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations. That’s a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that, but there’s something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy. We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani, and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world.",57.0

It absolutely does not.",26.0
02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Tom Steyer,"Being all by ourselves, being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world. So in fact, the USMCA is something, that’s the first step, but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying. Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers, but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal.",29.0
02-07-2020,New Hampshire Democratic Debate Transcript,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things aren’t always exactly how you would do them. But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think you’ve got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough.",31.0

He blames the King of Denmark, who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2, who does that? That’s what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation’s security.",56.0

His loyalty among African American voters. I have sat down with the vice president, he has told me it’s one of the things that he is most proud of, his loyalty among black supporters, and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base, all you have to look at are the numbers from 2016, the exit polls from that primary, 6 out of 10 voters in Mississippi were black, 61% of voters in the South Carolina primary were black, and that’s where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that.",36.0

The year was 1999 the question was our friend and former [inaudible 01:06:13] who may be watching right now, the late Cokie Roberts.",30.0

Today, nearly one in five American preschoolers are still living below the poverty line, even though we’ve had 10 straight years of economic growth.

Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day. So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, 40% of American children today are born to single moms, 90% of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth.",43.0

Coaches and mentors helping our kids? Zero. Most artists, sorry artists, but it’s true. Zero. Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can’t vote on something if you actually don’t have any news coverage. The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans.

I’m sure if you’ve got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you.

Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have. This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change. The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn’t happen.

I’ve talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.",61.0

It’s very simple. That’s what Mr. Trump’s plan is and it’s true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. It’s not just that he does bad things. He doesn’t understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it.

I visit our troops around the world. I’ve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I’ve been to lots of places to talk with our troops.

We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington, between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple.

And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isn’t so much about experience, it’s about judgment.

So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we’re looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense.

And look what’s happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened. We’re now isolated. We’re in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence. We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies.

Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm’s way, often on deployment after deployment, then we’ve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there.

Last night at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike 1974 and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have so far not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump.

I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden.",42.0

Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling that’s been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, “Stand fast,” and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And it’s about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well that’s not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate.

We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.",74.0

But the way I see this is we’ve now seen the impact of corruption, and that’s what’s clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else.

As a wise judge said, “The president is not king in America; the law is king.” And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he’s a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent.

Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, “Okay, we’re going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.” We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president.

Now, I don’t agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage.

They’re not eating more pizzas, they’re not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care.

It’s why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesn’t have to be free for the top. If you’re in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference.

Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the US reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year 2050 the damage will have been done. The climate change will have made certain places in the US unlivable. So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps. Davenport, Iowa.

12-19-2019,December Democratic Debate Transcript: Sixth Debate from Los Angeles,Democratic Debate Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I very much hope we’re not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents. And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California as was mentioned with Paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down.",39.0

So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration.

I believe I’m the only person here who will say unequivocally, this is my number one priority. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. I’ve been working on this for more than a decade. I’ve taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws.

Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we don’t declare a state of emergency on day one, I don’t understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead. Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage.

The answer’s yes, because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We’re the only country in the world’s ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. I’ve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn’t leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where there’s all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. We’re now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market.

It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You’re talking about the Paris Agreement, that’s fine. Ain’t enough. We have got to, and I’ve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world.

I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader.

It’s not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We’re seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who’s from the Midwest.",58.0

The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, “We need to protect our people from climate change?” Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground.

It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage.

And that’s what’s happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle, no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it. But I want to add one more part based on today’s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? This is not a man who had any qualifications except one.

This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country’s interest.

That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first 50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you’ve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Here’s the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It’s about saying you built something great in this country, good for you. But you did it using workers. All of us help pay to educate.

You might have a lot of days for early voting or fewer days or none. You might have a polling place in walking distance or you might have to drive or take a bus to the edge of town.

Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro democracy anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnell’s hands in the United States Senate. We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins.",53.0

I listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas, but I take a look at the issues we’ve talked about. We’ve talked about climate change, we’ve talked about defense spending, we’ve talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence. What do these issues have in common? Well first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. What is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we don’t make change. Why not? Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms, instead of into our public schools.",53.0

Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there’s already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office.

And I think that’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn’t think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that didn’t happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.",77.0

It’s not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.",55.0

This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment.

He’s been selling out working people. He’s been selling out our values, he’s been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, he’s been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances.

You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he’s digging up dirt on an opponent, that’s illegal conduct. That’s what he was doing. He didn’t talk to them about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that. So I’m still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again.

It’s also about the presidency itself because a president, 10 years or 100 years from now, will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion, either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.

We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want. Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family. And it can be delivered without [crosstalk 00:23:00]",61.0

The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we’re going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they’ll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax.

If you are asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying… the wealthiest, top one-tenth of 1%… start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that’s exactly what I believe.",71.0

There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people, and specifically on organized labor. The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It’s absolutely wrong. It’s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.",38.0

As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven’t had a raise. 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It’s seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it’d be over 20 bucks. There’s something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That’s why I’m running for president, because we’re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants… healthcare, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage-",46.0

I would eliminate the capital gains tax that… I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God’s name should someone who’s clipping coupons in the stock market make… in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is… like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter.

You can’t justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We can eliminate it all. I could go into detail, had I the time. Thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We’re going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given.

We have different ways. I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation.

The problem is that it’s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they’d projected. If we can’t learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries’ mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.",49.0

And it’s gotten worse and worse and we now know why.

And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That’s the first way. You can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help in rural areas where they’re so isolated, and also in urban areas where it’s, by the way, not just opioids, there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues.",32.0

I think that we’re on the right track, in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices. Setting, as Congressman O’Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today. Whether that’s Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business. Then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers. Not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should. Or it’s a number of other companies, big tech companies.

John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends, became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children and on his deathbed, he asked me to do his eulogy. I would say to John, “John, you didn’t see a war. You never wanted a fight.” And he’d say, “You didn’t see a problem.

He does not do anything to promote people generally. Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class and the only we’re going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle.

But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.

So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the prosecutor’s office they were handled with a grand jury. That’s how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office.

As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etc. The fact of the matter is that what’s happened is that we’re in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn’t be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime.

Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldn’t be in there for a misdemeanor. That should be a misdemeanor, they should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned.

Vice president Biden as a presidential candidate in 2008 you supported the border wall saying, “Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence.” This is what you said. Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in US history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations?

So that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams, and then you can have good job opportunities. Whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country. I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling and I know what that’s like too. I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I don’t want to make America anything again. I don’t want us to go backwards. We’re not going back to the past.

Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don’t believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you’ve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America’s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone.

Or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can’t provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. We’ve now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama.

They’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls, put together. What you see here in this trend line is it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating in. What I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark, his peak, as President. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. When was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become President. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70%, at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons.

Trump’s average support, at a low point, 36%. At a high point, about 43.5%.

The clear majority said Trump wasn’t qualified. Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like him, do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did. You’re not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was one of the big reasons his opponent, Hillary Clinton, by Election Day 2016, almost as unpopular as he was, only 43% favorable.

I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. It’s long overdue. It should end. And thirdly, I believe that you’re not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism.

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Savannah G.,"You have many plans. Free college, free childcare, government healthcare, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations, but this comes at a time when 71% of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60% of Democrats. What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It’s doing great for giant drug companies. It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled. It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African Americans and Latinx whose families were torn apart, whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us. When you’ve got a government, when you’ve got an autonomy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on, and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Savannah G.,"enator Klobuchar, you called programs like free college, “Something you might do if you were quote a magic genie.” To be blunt, are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering, giving your voters and people a false sense of what’s actually achievable?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"Well, first the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids. I do. But I think my plan is a good one, and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college. There’s many paths to success, as well as certifications.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"Secondly, I’d use Pell Grants. I’d double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to $100,000. Then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this, if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Savannah G.,"That’s time. Thank you. Congressman O’Rourke. What we’ve just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable. In that vein, some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70% on the very highest earners, those making more than $10 million a year. Would you support that? If not, what would your top individual rate be?",

That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest, a $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality. A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no packs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now.",

Senator Booker, there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations, as you know. Senator Warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. You’ve said we should not, “be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process.” Why do you disagree?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Cory Booker,"I don’t think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from Labor. We have people that work full-time jobs and still can’t make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs, and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that’s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Cory Booker,"One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. I’ll tell you this. I live in a low income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street’s rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Savannah G.,"Quickly, Senator Booker, you did say that you didn’t think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out as Senator Warren has briefly. Why is that?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Cory Booker,"Well again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. When it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is number one, appoint judges that will enforce it. Number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they’re trying to influence Washington. It’s about time that we have a President that fights for the people in this country.",

That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall, and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy. Now look, we’ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What’s been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants.

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Lester Holt,Secretary Castro. The next question is for you. Democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades. What would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country?,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Julian Castro,"Thank you very much for that question, Lester. I grew up with a mother who raised my brother Joaquin and me as a single parent, and I know what it’s like to struggle. I know what it’s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you’re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month, and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they’re women. I would do several things, starting with something we should’ve done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It’s past time that we did that and we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.",

Many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan. Just a show hands, start off with. All right. Well, Senator Klobuchar, let me put the question to you. You’re one of the Democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government healthcare plan. Why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"Well, I think it’s a bold approach. It’s something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"Let me go on beyond that. There’s a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals. The President literally went on TV on Fox and said that people’s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America that’s what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it, and so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, and pharma thinks they own Washington.

I spend a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. That’s not just for people who don’t have insurance. It’s for people who have insurance. Look at the business model of an insurance company. It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need.

I mean we should give everyone in this country healthcare as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people, and also it’s bad policy.

This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who were coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So they got frustrated, and they tried to cross the river. And they died because of that.",

And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle, not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem.

He wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Do you think it should be a civil offense only? And if so, do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are America. And I am happy to look at his proposal, but I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by people that came from other countries. 25% of our US Nobel laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories. We need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas, and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants.",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Savannah G.,"That’s time. Thank you. Congressman Ryan, same question. Should it be a crime to illegally cross the border or should it be a civil offense only?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Tim Ryan,"Well, I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they’re dealing in drugs and other things. That’s already established in the law. So there’s no need to repeat it. And I think it’s abhorrent. We’re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter. And the issues here, the way these kids are being treated, if you go to Guantanamo Bay, there are terrorists that are held that get better healthcare than those kids that have tried to cross the border into the United States. That needs to stop.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Tim Ryan,"And I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids. What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who’s focused on hate and fear and division? And what has happened now, the end result, is now we’ve got kids literally laying in their own snot with three week old diapers that haven’t been changed. We’ve got to tell this president that is not a sign [crosstalk 00:12:06] of strength, Mr. President. That is a sign of weakness.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Savannah G.,"Senator Booker, [crosstalk 00:12:10]. A lot of people… Jose asked a question. If you’re president, on day one what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There’s been a lot of talk about what you’ll do in the first 100 days about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Cory Booker,"Well, this is a related and brief point. Because what we’re talking about, what Secretary Castro and I are talking about, is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Cory Booker,"Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it’s immigration, whether it’s mental illness, whether it’s addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem. Donald Trump isn’t solving this problem. We’ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care, to affirm the values and human dignity the people that come here. Because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Savannah G.,All right Senator. Thank you. Let me go to Governor Inslee on this. What would you do on day one? Same question I just asked Cory Booker. I have yet to hear an answer from anyone [crosstalk 00:13:45] on this stage. What will you do with the families that will be here?,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Jay Inslee,"There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children. They should be released pending their hearings. And they should have a hearing, and the law should be followed. That’s what should happen. And we should do what we’re doing in Washington state. I’m proud that we’ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement for being turned into mini ICE agents. I’m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump’s heinous Muslim ban. I’m proud to be a person who is not only talked about dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Jay Inslee,"And I’ll leave you with this thought if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me. He thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees in Washington state if we passed a law that I passed, and I told him that’s not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we built America. That tradition is going to continue if I’m president of the United States.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Lester Holt,"Savannah, [crosstalk 00:14:53] if I could just… We’re going to switch to another topic now. [crosstalk 00:14:56] We’ve got a lot to get through. [crosstalk 00:00:14:58].",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,John Delaney,ust one more topic. My grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Lester Holt,"We’re going to talk about Iran right now because we’re working against the clock. Tankers have been attacked. A US drone has been shot down. There have been disturbing threats issued by both the US and Iranian leadership. I’d like if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here, but what I want to know is how to get dial it back? So a show of hands, who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated? What’s the answer? Well, Cory… Senator Booker, why not?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Cory Booker,"May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we’re seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled… being pulled in further and further into this crisis.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Cory Booker,"We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I’m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I’m going to rejoin that deal. Because when I am president of the United States, I’m going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I’m going to do it.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Lester Holt,"All right. [crosstalk 00:16:12] Senator Klobuchar, I’d like you to answer that question because you’ve said [crosstalk 00:16:15] you said you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Julian Castro,"Yes, it was.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that’s something we could negotiate to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians who claim now that they’re going to blow the caps on enriching uranium, and the Iranians have told us this. And so that’s where we are right now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Amy Klobuchar,"So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done. And then finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict, and we’re having this debate in Congress right now, that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that. And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war, and I don’t think we should conduct foreign policy [crosstalk 00:17:30] in our bathrobe at five in the morning.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Lester Holt,"Congresswoman Gabbard, you’ve said you would sign back onto the 2015 deal. Would you insist though that it address Iran’s support for Hezbollah?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Tulsi Gabbard,"Let’s deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chicken hawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms’ lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives, it would exacerbate the refugee crisis, and it wouldn’t be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Tulsi Gabbard,"his is why it’s so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say, “No war with Iran.” We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There are issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Lester Holt,"Your time is up, and I have just a very quick follow up. But what would your red line be for military action against Iran?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Tulsi Gabbard,"Obviously if there was an attack against the American… our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is, and it’s important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That’s why we need to deescalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride. Put the American people first.",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"All right, well on election day 2020 Donald Trump will be something he was not on election day 2016. That is president Donald Trump, an incumbent running for reelection. In some ways, a reelection campaign for a president of course becomes a referendum on how folks feel the president did during his four years in office.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"what can we say about how voters have been reacting so far to the Trump presidency? Well, what you see here, this is his average approval rating. Meaning you’ve always got these different polls out there. One day NBC will have one, the next day CNN will have one. They’re always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day to day average of all of those polls put together. And what you see here in this trend line is it’s a very narrow range that Trump is operating.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"And what I mean by that is, look at this. This is his high watermark. His peak as president. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. And when was this? Early February, 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become president. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70% at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons. Trump’s honeymoon, he couldn’t even crack 50%. So already we see a lower ceiling for Trump than we’ve seen with past presidents.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"But that comes with a flip side, and that is the basement for Trump. Look at this. 37% is the low point he’s hit in his average approval rating is president. That is actually not as low as some of his predecessors have gone. We’ve seen Nixon, Bush Senior, Carter. We saw them fall into the 20s at some point during their term. That has not happened to Trump either. 37 in the low end, 46 on the high end, right now somewhere in between. It’s a very narrow range. It speaks to polarization.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"I’ll tell you, it speaks to something else. Is this presidency really any different politically in terms of how it’s being received than the campaign in 2016? Because compare this trendline, 46, 37, low, high. Compare that to Trump’s support against Hillary Clinton in the polls in the fall of 2016. Trump’s average support at a low point, 36%, at a high point, about 43 and a half percent. Of course on election day what was the number he hit? 46%. The same high water mark he’s had in his approval rating. So Trump has been operating in the same range as a candidate, as president. We say it speaks to polarization. It also speaks to, look, this is somebody who succeeded as a candidate in 2016 despite some very, very high negative numbers.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 2,Steve Kornacki,"What I mean by that is look at this. The exit poll on election day, do you think Donald Trump’s qualified to be president Only 38% said they thought he was qualified for the job. The clear majority said Trump wasn’t qualified. Does he have the temperament? 35% said he had the temperament. Do you like them? Do you have a favorable view? Only 40% did. You’re not supposed to be able to win with those numbers. Trump was one of the big reasons his opponent, Hillary Clinton, by election day 2016 almost as unpopular as he was, only 43% favorable, it created that narrow path for Trump. And that becomes the question when you look at that approval rating now in 2020. Can he make his opponent as unpopular on election day as Clinton was in ’16?",

We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since.

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Hi, Chuck.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,How you doing?,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,Good.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"And we’ve got a lot of ground to cover. We’re going to be talking about guns and climate here up top, a whole lot more in this hour. Obviously because of the size of the field, not every person will be able to weigh in on everything. But over the course of this next hour, we will hear from everyone. I promise, everybody. And to begin with, we’re going to go with guns. And Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year, and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since. Many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban. But even if implemented, there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country. Should there be a role for the Federal government-",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 7,Yeah. Their mics are on.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,Everybody’s mics are on. I think we have a… I heard that too. That’s okay. Think we had a little mic issue in the back.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Control room, we’ve got contrary audio.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"I think we heard… Yeah, we have the audience audio. All right. So the question is simply this-",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,Sorry.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"I apologize, you guys didn’t get to hear this… The first part of the question. Obviously we’re not far from Parkland, Florida. Gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in Broward county. Many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions, some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban, but even if it’s put in place, there’s still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets. Is there a role for the federal government to play in order to get these guns off the streets?",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Guess what, guys. We are going to take a quick break. We’re going to get this technical situation fixed. We will be right back.",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,"All right. Let’s take a look at the electoral college and 2020. The place to start, obviously is where the last election ended, 2016. And remember of course by the popular vote Hillary Clinton had almost 3 million more of those than Donald Trump, but we don’t elect the president by national popular vote. We do it by the electoral college and there Donald Trump had the right combination of votes in the right states, enough to win 306 electoral votes for him.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,"o how is that map looking for 2020? Well first of all, I think one thing you need to do, just understand how narrow that Trump path was in the electoral college in 2016. You can start by looking at Wisconsin. Look at that margin there. Fewer than 25,000 votes separated Clinton from Trump in Wisconsin. This was a state that had not gone for a Republican in a presidential election since 1984, by a margin of fewer than 25,000 votes Trump becomes the first in over three decades. He gets Wisconsin. The margin in Michigan, even closer. Barely 10,000 votes, Trump over Clinton. And again, that was the first time since ’88 that a Republican carried Michigan. And then there was Pennsylvania here, about 44,000 votes. That the margin for Trump over Clinton in Pennsylvania. Trump wins all three of those states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, by a combined total of about 75,000 votes. That’s it. But that’s enough to win the electoral college.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,"o for Democrats, they want to reverse the result of 2016, that is the easiest and most direct path, at least on paper. You flip those states were Trump’s margin was the narrowest, those states that had been voting democratic before 2016, you flip them back, you win the electoral college if everything else stays the same. So that’s the most direct path for Democrats at least on paper. But hey, things can change over the course of a few years. There are other states to be keeping an eye on as well.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,"I’ll give you an example. Perfect one right here, Florida. We always talk about Florida, right? Remember Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida from back in 2000. Well here’s one, again Donald Trump was somewhat of a surprise on election night. I think the Clinton campaign had been feeling decent about Florida, but Trump pulled out Florida in 2016. 29 electoral votes right there. We obviously expect to be very competitive in 2020 if the Democrats can flip Florida, just given the size of the state that is a massive change. The one cautionary note for Democrats though, they had a big year in the 2018 midterms, it was not big enough to carry over to Florida. In Florida in the 2018 midterms, a Republican won the Governor’s race. Republican won the Senate race, ousted a Democratic incumbent, in fact in that Senate race. So Florida, it’s tantalizing on paper for Democrats. It’s always tantalizing on paper for Democrats, but does 2018 tell you that maybe there’s a little bit more Republican strength there in Florida.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 12,"And of course Arizona, this is one Democrats have been talking about now. A long time red state, the Democrats think demographically might be trending in their favor. This is a state Democrats did do well in in the 2018 midterms, winning a Senate race there. Clinton got within three points. Democrats hope that there is some momentum there, some demographic, some political momentum. And they can flip Arizona. That could change things too.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 13,I’ve been fighting these companies my whole life.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Speaker 14,Greencoat can cause cancer. They hid that. So that’s where the law comes in.,

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,We believe we have the technical difficulties fixed.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,Never say that.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Never say never, but we will march forward here. And I will lean forward here a little bit. Senator Warren, we’re going to get to a gun question here. Parkland, Florida, it’s just north of here in Broward County. As you know, it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue. It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns, including assault weapons ban, but even if you’re able to implement that, what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,"So in this period of time that I’ve been running for president, I’ve had more than 100 town halls. I’ve taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions. And the single hardest question I’ve gotten… I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl. And that is to say, “When you’re president, how are you going to keep us safe?” That’s our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers. And they won’t just die in mass shootings. They’ll die on sidewalks. They’ll die in playgrounds. They’ll die in people’s backyards. Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,"So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war. But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe. We need to treat this like the virus that’s killing our children.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,Okay. Thank you Senator Warren. You didn’t address… Do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,"So what I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done. You know, guns in the hands of a collector who’s had them for decades, who’s never fired… Who take safety seriously. That’s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly. We can’t treat this as an across the board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether it’s politically popular or not.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Okay. Thank you Senator. Senator Booker, you have a program-",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,need to fight for our children.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Senator Booker, you have a federal government buy back program in your plan, how is that going to work?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Cory Booker,"Well, first of all, I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what’s even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I’m the only. I hope I’m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue, this is an urgency. And for those who have not been directly effected, they’re tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Cory Booker,"This is something that I’m tired of. And I’m tired of hearing people… All they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say “Faith without works is dead.” So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we’ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"ank you, Senator Booker.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Secretary Castro, I’d like to talk to you about something that Senator Booker just mentioned there, the idea of active shooter drills in schools. School shootings seem like an almost every day or every week occurrence now. They don’t make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll. As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes, or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Julian Castro,"Yeah, Rachel, I’m the dad of a 10 year old girl, Carina, who’s here tonight, and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that’s supposed to be safe. The answer to your question is no, we don’t have to accept that. And I believe that on January 20, 2021 at 12:01 pm, we’re going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Julian Castro,"And the activists of Parkland, folks from moms to men who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people. You know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we’re getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing common sense gun reform, I’m going to choose common sense gun reform. So I believe that we’re going to be able to get that done in 2021.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Secretary Castro, thank you.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tim Ryan,"chel, I have something to add to this briefly.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"We’ll give you 30 seconds for follow up on that question, on that answer from Secretary Castro, Congressman Ryan.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tim Ryan,"You were talking about, in the schools, these kids are traumatized. I support all the gun reforms here. We need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have. We need trauma based care in every school. We need social and emotional learning in every school. 90% of the shooters who do school shooting, come from the school they’re in and 73% of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school. That means a mental health counselor in every single school in the United States. We need to start playing offense. If our kids are so traumatized that they’re getting a gun and going into our schools, we’re doing something wrong too and we need reform around trauma based care.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Congressman… Thank you, Congressman Ryan.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"ngressman O’Rourke, you’re a Texan that’s campaigned… You campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there, what do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else? Okay? But says, “You know what? The Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they’re going to take my gun away. And even though I agree with you on all these other issues…” How do you have that conversation?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Beto O’Rourke,"Here’s how we had that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting. A young student named Bri, her friend Marcel who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Heart… They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Beto O’Rourke,"And what I found in each one of those 254 counties, is that Democrats, and Independents, and Republicans, gun owners and non-gun owners alike agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida and they’ve been able to change those laws. They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"ank you, Congressman O’Rourke. Hang on. Let me give 30 seconds, Senator Klobuchar, the Iron Range, I’m curious. Gun confiscation, right? If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Amy Klobuchar,"Well that’s not confiscation. You would give them the offer to buy back their gun. But I’ll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, “Does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand?” Coming from a proud hunting and fishing state. These proposals don’t do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapon ban. When I was in the senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed. And then, now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift. You know why? It’s just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents and their grandparents, they say, “I don’t understand why we can’t put these sensible things in place.” They listen. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds, it’s the best thing that’ll ever happen. We need to get this done.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Senator, thank you. Senator, thank you.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Senator Booker, let me go to you on another matter actually. Senator Mitch McConnell says that his most consequential achievement as Senate Majority Leader, was preventing President Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat. Having served with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, do you believe they would confirm your court nominees?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Cory Booker,"I’m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say this. One thing we don’t all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it’s common sense and over 70% of Americans agree with me… If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that, but in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40% drops in gun violence and 15% drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Cory Booker,"When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly we… I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro, we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jaime Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we can win a Senate seat there. This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we can not only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn’t so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,John Delaney,We have to actually-,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Congressman Delaney, you’ll have some time in a moment on this issue.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,John Delaney,This issue is related to-,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"yor De Blasio, as an executive in the largest city in this country, you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate Majority Leader, what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Bill de Blasio,"Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation’s largest city and I also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question. Look. I run the largest police force in America too and if we’re going to stop these shootings, if we’re going to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community. I also want to say that something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is for the last 21 years I’ve been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very very serious talks with my son Dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too. As we saw recently in Indiana.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Bill de Blasio,"So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together. We’ve done that in New York City and we’ve driven down crime while we’ve done it.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Bill de Blasio,"ut to your question about Mitch McConnell, there’s a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states, including red states, to convince people we’re on their side, we could put pressure on their Senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward, decent [inaudible 00:18:56] deserve that right.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"Thank you, Mayor De Blasio.",

We’re trying… I know you guys… We got other issues we’re trying to get to, including a big one coming up in a minute, but Senator Warren, I want to continue on the Mitch McConnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,I do.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Do you have a plan for that? Okay. We talked about the Supreme Court, do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don’t beat him in the Senate, if he’s still sitting there as the Senate Majority Leader, it’s very plausible you’d be elected president with a Republican Senate. Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Elizabeth Warren,"I do. We are a democracy. And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now we for far too long have had a congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country. They have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people. Well here’s how I see this happening. Number one, sure. I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the senate. But short of the Democratic majority in the senate, you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this congress reflect the will of the people.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"Okay. I’m going to get a couple of you in here. I’m going to get you a couple in here. 30 seconds. Congressman Delaney, you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn’t operate that way. He operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,John Delaney,"I think we need to get things done. That’s why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner. Listen, I’ll sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party line basis, absolutely. But all the big, transformative things we’ve ever done in this country’s history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises. We need to put forth ideas that work, whether it’s on healthcare, creating universal healthcare so that every American gets healthcare, but not running on making private insurance illegal. The gun issue is related. The gun safety issue is related because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been with folks in western Maryland and they’ve said to me, “You know, Democrats don’t do anything for us. Republicans don’t do anything for us. You fight all the time.” So they vote on that single issue. If we become the party of getting things done for the American people with real solutions no impossible promises-",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Cory Booker,"You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African American man in an African American dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform. From police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850. And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate. Bill coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the First Step Act. It’s not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. I’ve taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and I’ve been able to get things accomplished.",

You have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change. It is first, second, and third priority for you. You’ve said it’s all the issues. Let’s get specific. We’re here in Miami, which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise. Parts of Miami Beach and the Keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Jay Inslee,"Yes. First by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell to start with. We have to do that. Look. Look. We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something about it. Our towns are burning, our fields are flooding, Miami is inundated. And we have to understand this is a climate crisis, an emergency. And it is our last chance in an administration, next one, to do something about it. And we need to do what I have done in my state. We’ve passed a 100% clean electrical grid bill. We now have a vision statement. My plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Jay Inslee,"But the most important thing on this, and the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority? And I am the candidate and the only one who’s saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what we’ve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put eight million people to work. That’s what we’re going to do.",

You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time, including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas-powered cars in favor of electric ones. What’s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you’re trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government’s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live? What is that balance like?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Beto O’Rourke,"I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone. We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa, and every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes. Those farms already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do.",

We’re going to mobilize five trillion dollars in this economy over the next 10 years. We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels. And we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat. Renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil. Paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees Celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential.",

Secretary Castro, does who pays for the mitigation to climate, whether it’s building sea walls… For people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn’t be living, is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that where maybe they’re building a house someplace that isn’t safe, who pays to build that house? And how much should the government be bailing them out?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Julian Castro,"Well, I don’t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn’t to Iowa or New Hampshire, it was to San Juan, Puerto Rico because people should know that if I’m elected president, everybody will count. And you know, I’m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility. We began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD Secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. That’s the way that we’re going to help make sure that we’re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change. And if I’m elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that-",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Chuck Todd,"ngressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here which is simply this. A lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it’s Washington state where voters voted it down. You’ve had the yellow vest movement. We had in Australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer. If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tim Ryan,"Well, there’s a variety of different ways to pay. We talk about different ways of raising revenue and I think we’ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tim Ryan,"But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate. We could talk about guns. We could talk about all of these issues that we all care about. We have a perception problem with the Democratic party. We are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that I represent, in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We’ve lost all connection. We have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic party from being coastal and elitist and Ivy league, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years to get those workers back on our side so we can say we’re going to build electric vehicles. We’re going to build solar panels. But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out and if you want to take Lindsey Graham out, you got to have blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in South Carolina.

One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBTQ community about your past stances and statements on gay rights. After the Trump administration’s rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community, why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general trust you now?",

My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today. I’ve served with LGBTQ service members, both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I’ll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families.

Civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African Americans. We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African American trans Americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don’t talk enough about how many children, about 30% of LGBTQ kids who do no go to school because of fear. It’s not enough just to be on the equality act. I’m an original co-sponsor.

For decades… On the issue of civil rights and demographics honestly, and politics. For decades the Democratic party has counted on African American voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you’re your party’s nominee?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Amy Klobuchar,"My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want to have an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs. In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead Democrat… Okay, that’s a first up here… Was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Amy Klobuchar,"So to me, this is about a few things. It’s about an African American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It’s about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes.",

This is a 70% Latino city here in Miami. You are the only Latino Democrat who is running this year in the presidential race. Is that enough of an answer? What Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda, is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic party in a big way?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Julian Castro,"Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice.

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Lester Holt,"And I’m over here, Chuck. Thanks. We asked voters across the country to submit their questions to the candidates. Let me read one now. This comes from John in New York who submitted this question. He asks, “Does the United States have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity? Do we have a responsibility to intervene, to protect people threatened by their governments, even when atrocities do not affect American core interests?” I’d like to direct that question to Congressman O’Rourke.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Beto O’Rourke,"John, I appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward. But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country. Less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same. He’s embraced strong men and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger.",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Bill de Blasio,"What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation, with deep respect to the Congressman. Look, we’ve learned painful lessons as Americans that we’ve gone to war without congressional authorization. And look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the US Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didn’t kill him, but that war did. And look, even in the humanitarian crisis… And I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene god forbid there is a genocide, but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans, both in the Congress, have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten. The decisions have to be made by the United States Congress in the name of the people.",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Rachel Maddow,"I’m going to pick up on this point and I want to put this to Congressman Ryan. Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American service members in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said that they want to end US involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn’t over for America. Why isn’t it over? Why can’t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there and how could you?",
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tim Ryan,"I appreciate that question. So I’ve been in congress 17 years and 12 of those years I’ve sat on the Armed Services Committee, the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee, and the lesson that I’ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It’s long. It’s tedious. But right now we have… So I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our state department engaged. We much have our military engaged to the extent they need to be. But the reality of it is, this president doesn’t even have people appointed in the state department to deal with these things, whether we’re talking about Central America, whether we’re talking about Iran, whether we’re talking about Afghanistan, we’ve got to be completely engaged. And here’s why. Because these flare ups distract us from the real problems in the country. If we’re getting drones shot down for 130 million dollars because the president is distracted, that’s 130 million dollars that we could be spending in places like Youngstown, Ohio or Flint, Michigan or rebuilding-",

06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Tulsi Gabbard,"Is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? “Well we just have to be engaged.” As a soldier, I will tell you that answer is unacceptable. We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. We’ve spent so much money, money that’s coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home. We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why it’s so important to have a president, commander in chief, who knows the cost of war and who’s ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.",

No I mean that in a… That’s what this debate is about. This is the best part of a debate like this. Congressman O’Rourke, special council Robert Mueller’s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump. House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the House. If the House chooses not to impeach, as president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller’s report?",

That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years.,
06-26-2019,Transcript from Night 1 of the 2019 June Democratic Debates,Part 3,Beto O’Rourke,"If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand. So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we followed them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy. And if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice. Its the only way that we save this country.",

No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?",

I support Speaker Pelosi’s decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker.

But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when you’re out doing as much campaigning as I have done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number one issue the American people ask us about. It’s not. They want to know what we’re going to do for healthcare, how we are going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we are going to build infrastructure, what we’re going to do to create jobs in their communities. You know last year in our country 80% of the money for startup businesses went to 50 counties in this country. There’s over 3,000 counties in this country. That’s what they care about. They care about what’s going on in the public schools. They care about what’s going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their healthcare, with infrastructure. These are the issues, these kind of kitchen table pocketbook issues are actually what most Americans care about. They never ask about the Mueller report.",
